Impact of Car Features


The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with a growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. With increasing competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape, it has become more important than ever to understand the factors that drive consumer demand for cars.
In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards electric and hybrid vehicles and increased interest in alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen and natural gas. At the same time, traditional gasoline-powered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel types and grades available to consumers.

For the given dataset, as a Data Analyst, the client has asked How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?
This problem could be approached by analyzing the relationship between a car's features, market category, and pricing, and identifying which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer. By using data analysis techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation, the manufacturer could develop a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability, and identify which product features to focus on in future product development efforts. This could help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in the market and increase its profitability over time.

Description of the Dataset:
The Dataset consists of different car features and their MSRP. There are a total of 11159 rows and 16 columns which is in CSV format. Below given are the variables of the dataset.
Make: Brand of the car
Model: Specific model
Year: Year the car is released
Engine Fuel Type: Type of fuel used (eg: Diesel)
Engine HP: Horsepower of engine
Engine Cylinders: No. of cylinders present in engine
Transmission Type: Type of transmission (eg:automotive)
Driven_wheels: Type of wheels present (front,all)
No. of Doors: No of Doors present in the car 
Marketing Type: Type of market the car belongs to
Vehicle size: Size of the car



## Business Problem

There is a rapid growth in automotive industry from past 2 decades. The growth electric and hybrid vehicles increased fuel efficiency which brought demand for hydrogen and natural gas. As a data analyst we have to optimise the price based on the features on consumer demand. The price is set and decided in such a way to increase the profitability. This problem is solved by finding various car features based on consumers interests. The relationship between the car features and estimated price is found by regression analysis. We obtain clear analysis of optimizing the price by following regression method. Therefore price is set by understanding the overall car features that makes profitability to the industry.

Tasks:

Task 1.A: Popularity of a car model across different market categories
